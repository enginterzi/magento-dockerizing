# Magento seamless Dockerizing 
I have been working on clouds at the IaaS layer over 10 years. With Amazon AWS and Google GCE 
now providing large-scale cloud service for several years, it is fair to say that getting access
to a server has never been easy and quick.

However, application packing, configuration and composing of service in ditributed enviroment 
has not progressed much despite a lot of work in configuration management and orchestiration.

Deploying and running a distributed application at scale and in a fault-tolerant manner is still hard.

Dockerizing is not about full virtualization versus containers; it's about the easy of packing and running
an application.
